        I enjoy seeing my clients progress their physical capabilities. I
        believe that improvements don’t come without hard work and that the
        right attitude is the key to unlocking your potential. I have a wide
        range of experience in Martial Arts from being part of the England
        Karate squad at age 15, to training in Thai Boxing, Brazilian Jujitsu
        (BJJ) and Boxing. ​

        I specialize in Functional Movements with basic Pilates and incorporate
        fat burning, strength training, core stability, Calisthenics (body
        weight training), circuit training and padwork into my client’s
        workouts. ​{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also trained in Thai Massage and Sports Massage which helps to
        relieve physical and emotional tension, improves sleep and flexibility
        and creates greater awareness of body and mind, releasing blocked
        energy.

          <h2>PERSONAL TRAINING</h2>
          <p>
            I motivate clients by setting goals and providing feedback and
            accountability to clients. I also measure client's strengths and
            weaknesses with fitness assessments. These fitness assessments may
            also be performed before and after an exercise program to measure
            client's improvements in physical fitness. I also educate clients in
            many other aspects of wellness besides exercise, including general
            health and nutrition guidelines.

          <h2>MASSAGE THERAPY</h2>
          <p>
            Sports massage is designed to assist in correcting problems and
            imbalances in soft tissue that are caused from repetitive and
            strenuous physical activity and trauma. The application of sports
            massage, prior to and after exercise, may enhance performance, aid
            recovery and prevent injury.
