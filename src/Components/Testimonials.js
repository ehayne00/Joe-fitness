        Here's what a few clients and colleagues have to say:

          “We have been with Joe for 12 weeks and after the first couple could
          immediately begin to see the difference. Every session felt different
          but I could certainly feel it for the next couple of days. I have no
          hesitations in recommending Joe.”

          “‘Joe has helped me transform my body using a combination of
          kettlebells, strength, endurance and interval training. I have become
          muscular, reduced my body fat percentage, and become stronger and
          fitter. He helped me go further than I could ever go on my own!’

          “I came to Joe with the ambitious goal of getting me fit for 105-hour
          football match. The event required unique levels of endurance as well
          as physical and mental conditioning. Joe did a great job of
          understanding the task at hand, assessing my current fitness levels
          and educating me on what I needed to do to get to my goal. In July
          2015 I successfully completed the challenge and there is no way I
          could have done it without Joe’s help. His knowledge on stretching and
          conditioning my muscles during the event also came in really handy and
          people were impressed with my levels of knowledge (I passed it off as
          my own, naturally) I worked with Joe for nearly 10 weeks and cannot
          recommend him highly enough. Not only was he a top class PT but he’s a
          great guy and just about made the 6am session bearable with his good
          humour and variety in exercise. If you are reading this… DO IT and you
          will have no regrets and a 6-pack!”

          As a Pilates Instructor (and anatomy geek), I really appreciate
          working with a trainer who has such a wealth of knowledge, skill and
          expertise as Joe. Joe is a master of finding any muscle weaknesses and
          uses his knowledge to devise a challenging and effective exercise
          programme to correct them. Joe is an excellent trainer; his easy going
          nature, encouragement and humour makes our sessions a pleasure.

          Joe is an extremely competent and affable trainer whose knowledge of
          the subject is as helpful as it is impressive. I hadn't done much by
          way of body weight training, but under his tutelage and constant
          improvisation, the workouts never got dull or too easy. He worked
          around my weak spots, some of which I didn't know I even had, and by
          exploiting them, made me stronger. He was always ready with an at-home
          stretch or exercise to help with tight muscle groups and my stiff
          lower back. Always punctual and seemingly excited, I would highly
          recommend Joe to people wanting strength training, cardio or pain
          relief.
